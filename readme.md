### Project - Audio fingerprinting with Python

We want to create some tools that wrap around audio recognizing with dejavu.

To make it easy to add songs to our database, we have spent time making a program, that you give a search query (song - artist), which it then searches for, downloads, converts to mp3 and fingerprints into the database. Then it can be recognized afterwards.

We will make the changes to the dejavu project that makes it more efficient - Change timed searches to confidence level based searches

### Installation

We recommend running the project on a local MySQL Database. Create a database, and a user with permissions for that Database, and put in your settings in dejavu.cnf

Currently only supported on
Linux/Mac:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kasperonfire/ImpossibleTechnologyProject
cd ImpossibleTechnologyProject
chmod +x DejavuSetup.sh
./DejavuSetup.sh
```

Full List of all dependencies, if something should fail:
apt:

```bash
Python3
MySql
portaudio19-dev
ffmpeg
```

Python libraries:

```bash
numpy
pydub
wavio
matplotlib
scipy
pyaudio
pyqtgraph
youtube-dl
```

### Usage

To Download a song to learn directory:

```bash
python dejavu/youtube.py -v "search query - can be one word, or artist + title, or anything"
```

To Learn the songs in the learn directory:

```bash
python dejavu/learner.py
```

To Recognize a song:

```bash
python dejavu/visualize_pyqtgraph.py
```
