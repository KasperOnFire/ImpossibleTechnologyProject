### Project - Audio fingerprinting with Python

We want to create some tools that wrap around audio recognizing with dejavu.

To make it easy to add songs to our database, we have spent time making a program, that you give a search query (song - artist), which it then searches for, downloads, converts to mp3 and fingerprints into the database. Then it can be recognized afterwards.

We will make the changes to the dejavu project that makes it more efficient - Change timed searches to confidence level based searches
